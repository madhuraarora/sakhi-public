# Sakhi (Public Version)

This is the **public version** of the Sakhi website repo.  
It has been edited to remove or obfuscate sensitive files, such as email configurations and environment variables.

Sakhi is a social venture aimed at making menstrual health more accessible, affordable, and less isolating.

The site was created to establish a digital presence for the initiative and to share its story, goals, and ongoing work.
